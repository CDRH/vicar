            Vicar is an <a href="http://www.mellon.org">Andrew Mellon Foundation</a> funded web application which provides researchers with an easy and fast way to convert their data files into a <a href="http://monkproject.org">MONK</a> compatible format using <a href="http://monkproject.org/docs/abbot.html">Abbot</a>.  Vicar was developed by Frank Smutniak at the <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu">Center for Digital Research in the Humanities</a> at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln.
        </p>
        
        <p>MONK (Metadata Offer New Knowledge) is a web based system for undertaking text analysis and visualization with large full-text literary archives.  These archives are represented in various dialects of the TEI XML schema.  Disparate uses and interpretations for the TEI element set has led to complications in the use of MONK for any TEI file.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Abbot, a standalone XSLT program written by Brian Pytlik-Zillig, was created to read different files and convert them to a core set of TEI elements named TEI-A such that MONK could use them consistently.  Abbot harvests the schema of a collection of submitted files and creates another XSLT program to convert those files to TEI-A for use in MONK or elsewhere.  Further work by Stephen Ramsey gave Abbot a clojure wrapper which allows its invocation by Vicar and other software components.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Vicar provides researchers with access to an up to date version of Abbot on a server at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln.  Vicar allows users to upload multiple large XML or compressed collections of XML files and process those files using Abbot with standard or user supplied custom schemas.  Validation checks are performed on the resultant TEI-A output files.  Output files can then be downloaded individually or as a single compressed file.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Vicar diminishes the need for MONK users to install and maintain a local copy of Abbot.

        <p>Abbot is a tool designed to convert dissimilar collections of
 XML texts into a common interoperable form. Abbot's key feature is the 
ability to read an XML schema file and output procedures to convert 
source files into a valid form that is consistent with the target 
schema. Abbot's schema-harvesting procedures focus on TEI, but are 
extremely flexible and format agnostic. Abbot makes no particular 
judgment or demand concerning the type of interoperability sought. It 
can transform texts into a variety of TEI schema, and accommodates user 
customization.</p>
        
        <p>Abbot is more likely than conventional file-conversion 
methods to spot and deal with problems because it operates consistently 
and algorithmically across large numbers of texts. Abbot sets its course
 on an ambitious but sensible path&#8212;moving toward total 
interoperability, while at the same time accepting the uniqueness of 
individual text collections. Abbot's method allows for different forms 
of interoperability, from small, one-off instances to the creation of 
large, permanent digital libraries.</p>
        
        <p>Abbot was developed at the <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu/">Center for Digital Research in the Humanities</a> by Brian L. Pytlik Zillig, Stephen Ramsay, Martin Mueller, and Frank Smutniak. Support for Abbot was provided by the <a href="http://www.mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>.</p>
        
        
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>In order for your data files to persist between sessions, you are required to sign in.</p>

<p>You may sign in with a Vicar account or use an account from either yahoo.com or gmail.com.</p>

<p>Create a local account directly with Vicar by clicking on the REGISTER
 link and entering your email address and a new Vicar-specific password.
  You will receive a confirmation link via email.  Click on this link to
 activate your account.</p>

<p>If you have a yahoo.com or gmail.com account, you can bypass Vicar 
registration and use one of these accounts instead.  Clicking on the 
respective links allows you to sign into your yahoo.com or gmail.com 
account and have the respective site relay verification to Vicar.</p>

<p>Access to your data collections is tied to your email address. You must sign in using the same method each time.<br></p>

<h3>Operation</h3>
<p>
You can create collections and upload your input and schema files once 
you are signed in.  Click on CREATE NEW COLLECTION and enter a name 
containing only letters a-z and A-Z with no spaces.  Press SAVE to 
create your collection.  Since it is new, it will be empty.  Clicking on 
COLLECTIONS will show a list of your collections.  Select a 
collection name to see its contents and add files. 
</p>

<p>
You can add individual files or multiple files at once if such actions 
are supported by your browser (see Notes).  You can also upload a zip 
file containing multiple XML data files.  Click on the UNZIP link and 
the contents of the zip file will be unpacked into the collection.
</p>

<p>
Once you have files in your collection, you will see a dropdown menu with
 schema names and a button with three green 'greater than' arrows.  The 
schema list will show Vicar-provided schema names listed in blue.  User-supplied schema names appear at the end of the list in black.
</p>

<p>
Select a schema and then click on the arrow button to invoke file 
conversion.  Vicar will show the progress of the Abbot conversion and 
will populate an output directory with the result of its run.  Each 
file will, to its right, have a green OK in a green outline or a red 
number in a red outline.  This is the result of schema validation.  The 
red number is the number of errors found by the validation software.  
Clicking on the red number will show the errors reported from the 
validation stage. An OK indicates that the file is valid.
</p>

<p>
Click on an individual XML output file to display its contents and save
 it to your local computer.  If the output contains multiple files you 
will be given an option to package and download them as a single zip 
file.
</p>

<p>
Your files will persist in your collections until you delete them or until your account is inactive for a duration to be determined.  Delete your 
collection and its contents by clicking on the red X in COLLECTIONS.
</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Vicar works best with most up-to-date browsers which support HTML5.  
HTML5 compatibility is needed for multiple file uploads. Single 
uploads will still be possible without it.
</p>

<p>
Vicar works best with javascript enabled.  A browser which has 
javascript disabled will not allow mutliple uploads nor will it display 
progress bars related to uploads or conversions but should otherwise be 
functional. 
</p>

<p>
During this beta stage no single uploaded input file can exceed 15MB.
