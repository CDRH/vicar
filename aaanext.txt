Need to use a properties file for global settings which differ from abbot and other computers.

May also want properties file for different schema rng files per brian's May 25th email including dropdown menu for schemas.
Fix FileManager page to have preselected the most recent schema used.

Finish progress bar work in dir Prog.  Ask Steve if files are written serially or in parallel.

DONE Return error message if user twiddles with the url and names a dir that does not exist or changes some other parameter.

DONE Fix FileDownload.java to use either the end of the url or fn (or dir as part of url).  Check that file actually exists and return a better error msg if it does not. (gives 'XML Parsing Error' now)

other languages?
Web Accessability (508?)
