<div class="banner">VICAR SOFTWARE (version 0.8 Dec 15, 2012)</div>

<div class="header">ORGANIZATION</div>

<div>
Vicar is an Apache Cocoon based application which consists of an ant build.xml and build.local.properties file, a cocoon sitemap.xmap file, and java source code, javascript, css, and XSLT files in the Server directory.  The Server directory contains a few top level files and six subdirectories.
</div>

<div>
Vicar allows two types of sign in.  Both of these are implemented within Server.Signin;
<ul>

	<li>
		Local sign in - This requires registration with Vicar of an email address and the creation of a new password.  A confirmation link is sent to the email address of registration.  Once the user recieves that email and clicks on the provided link the associated account will be active.
	</li>

	<li>
		OpenID sign in - OpenID enables the use of a user's Yahoo or Google ID for Signin. (For more information on OpenID, visit http://openid.net.)
Vicar's OpenID access uses the JOpenID library JOpenId-1.08.jar from http://code.google.com/p/jopenid/.  (There are several others to choose from at http://openid.net/developers/libraries/ but this one seemed to be the easiest with which to get started, especially within a servlet or cocoon generator.  OpenSignin.java is based on some of their sample code.)
		Users who have registered a local account with Vicar with either a yahoo.com or gmail.com address may access the same account with OpenID signin using the same email address.
	</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
Once signed in most of the work is performed by XML generators which control top level actions and produce output interpreted by XSLT programs.
</div>
<div>
Users who are signed in will work entirely from the main page of Vicar.html which is produced by the generator Server.Core.Vicar and the XSLT program Server/Core/Vicar.xsl.  This page will be used for creating and managing collections.  Three other generator or generator/XSLT pairs serve core actions on this page such as uploading files, converting and validating files, and downloading output;

<ul>
	<li>
		Server.Upload.AjaxServer - Used for uploading multiple files simultaneously from an HTML5 input form.
	</li>
	<li>
		Server.Convert.StreamServer - Invoked with a click to the Convert button.  This generator calls Server.Convert.AbbotConvert which invokes Abbot, performs a correction of output files, validates the output files against their schemas, and reports progress via StreamClient.html.
	</li>
	<li>
		Server.Core.FileDownload - Used for downloading output files directly to a user's local computer in plain or zip or tar or tar.gz format.
	</li>
</ul>
All other files in Server.Upload, Server.Convert, and Server.Core exist to support these main functions.
</div>

<div class="header">DATA STORAGE</div>

<div>
All vicar data files are stored in the path specified by BASE_USER_DIR in src/edu/unl/abbot/vicar/Global.java.
</div>

<div>
In addition to user data this directory contains the map.ser file which contains user account information, the log.txt file which records notable Vicar activity, and schemadescription.properties which holds text descriptions of schemas.
</div>

<div>
Each user account has it's own subdirectory - the name of which is a slight munge of the sign in name.  Each user directory contains subdirectories which reflect the names of thier collections.  Each user directory may also have a session.txt file which stores session information from their most recent activity.
</div>

<div>
Each collection subdirectory has four subdirectories; <i>input</i>,<i>convert</i>,<i>output</i>, and <i>valid</i> which contains the user uploaded input XML files, schema (.rng) files, output files, and validation result (.html) files respectively.
</div>


<div class="header">DEPLOYMENT</div>

<div>
Vicar is built as a cocoon.2.11 server application.  For more information about cocoon.2.11 and installation instructions visit
<a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/installing/index.html">http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/installing/index.html</a>
</div>

<div class="subheader">DOWNLOAD</div>
<div>
Download Vicar from https://github.com/CDRH/vicar.
</div>

<div class="subheader">SET UP DIRECTORIES AND EDIT BUILD.XML</div>

<div>
To install Vicar on your local cocoon server you will need to create one directory for the Vicar software and locate 3 others.  You will need to declare these directories in build.xml or build.local.properties.
</div>
<ul>
	<li>
		<i>builddir</i> - Where ant will place the compiled .class files.
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>libdir</i> - Where cocoon will look for various jar files which are part of cocoon.
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>corelibdir</i> - The path to core jar files which are found as part of tomcat in a tomcat based cocoon install, or as part of cocoon in a jetty based install.
	</li>
</ul>

<div>
If you have a jetty install (install which is started with the cocoon.sh command), these 3 directories will be found in your cocoon install's subdirectory build/webapp/WEB-INF/ (classes, lib, and lib/core, respectively).
</div>

<div>
If you have a tomcat install, the first 2 directories will be in the cocoon directory which was created by the unpacking of the cocoon.war file.   For tomcat 7, this is in /var/lib/tomcat-7/webapps/cocoon/.  The third directory will be part of the tomcat install.  For tomcat 7, this is in either /usr/share/tomcat-7/ or /var/lib/tomcat-7/lib/ (depends on your install).  Earlier versions of tomcat may have a different directory arrangement.
</div>


<div class="subheader">UPLOAD JAR FILES</div>

<div>
The directory <i>libdir</i> will need the addition of several jar files and one possible removal.
<ul>
	<li>
		servlet-api.jar - This jar contains the classes necessary for servlets 3.0 and should be in <i>corelibdir</i>. If you are using a jetty cocoon implementation then you will need to get the servlet-api.jar and put it in the <i>corelibdir</i> directory so that build.xml will compile using servlet-api.jar instead of servlet_2_2.jar.  The latest version of tomcat has servlet-api.jar in it's <i>corelibdir</i>.
	</li>
	<li>
		JOpenId-1.08.jar - This jar gives the ability to accept openid login from OpenSignin/OpenSignin.java.  It can be found at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jopenid/">http://code.google.com/p/jopenid/</a>.  
	</li>
	<li>
		abbot-0.4.9.jar (or later) - This jar implements <a href="http://monkproject.org/docs/abbot.html">Abbot</a> and it's java API.  It can be found at <a href="https://github.com/CDRH/abbot/downloads">https://github.com/CDRH/abbot/downloads</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		commons-compress-1.3.jar -  This jar enables the unpacking and packing of tar files used in Core/ZipUtil.java.  It can be downloaded from <a href="http://commons.apache.org/compress/">http://commons.apache.org/compress/</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		mail.jar - This jar is needed by Signin/SendMailSSL.java so that Vicar can send out registration and reset password messages.  Download from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javamail/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javamail/index.html</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		geronimo-spec-javamail-1.3.1-rc5.jar - You will likely need to REMOVE geronimo-spec-javamail-1.3.1-rc5.jar from the cocoon.2.11 install as this collides with mail.jar.
	</li>
<!--
	<li>
		junit-4.10.jar - This jar is needed for junit testing (for build.xml's junit target).  junit-4.10.jar can be found at <a href="https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads">https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads</a>.
  (This jar should probably be put outside of the cocoon directories but, for the sake of uniform structure between local installs and that on abbot, it is currently in the libdir.  This is in part because there is already a junit.jar in /usr/share/junit/lib/ on abbot.unl.edu which appears to be an older version or otherwise incompatible.  It does not contain the org.junit packages.)
	</li>
-->
</ul>
</div>

<div class="subheader">EDIT GLOBAL.JAVA</div>

<div>
You will also need to edit src/edu/unl/abbot/vicar/Global.java to reflect the current installation.
</div>
<div>
This is the URL at which Vicar will be located.  It is used by Signin.java, OpenSignin.java and Password.java to redirect after an OpenID signin or send password/registration information to the user.  If you are running it on your own computer that should likely be <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888">http://127.0.0.1:8888</> for a jetty install and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080">http://127.0.0.1:8080</a> for a tomcat install.
</div>

<div class="subheader">COMPILE</div>

<div>
Compile using ant.  Compilation of Vicar is the default action of the build.xml file.
</div>


<div class="subheader">DECLARE VICAR TO COCOON</div>

<div>
Create and entry in your cocoon server's sitemap.xmap file (in [cocoon_install]/build/webapp/ for jetty installs or in [tomcat_install]/webapps/cocoon/ for tomcat installs) will need a <map:pipeline> entry for the files in your created directory such as;
</div>

<pre>
&lt;map:match pattern="vicar/**"&gt;
	&lt;map:mount check-reload="yes"
		src="[your_home_dir]/vicar/"
		uri-prefix="vicar" /&gt;
&lt;/map:match&gt;
</pre>

<div>
This lets cocoon find your Vicar specific sitemap.xmap and Vicar's .xsl files.
</div>


<div class="subheader">TEST</div>
<div>
View Vicar in your browser either at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:888/cocoon/">http://127.0.0.1:8888/cocoon/vicar/Core/FileManager.html for a jetty install or http://127.0.0.1:8080/cocoon/vicar/Core/FileManager.html for a tomcat install.
