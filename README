There are currently two components to vicar; the Servlets code and the Cocoon code.

The Cocoon directory contains the core project which is built as a cocoon generator with xslt processing of the generator output.  This core callsd a small servlet component to read the html5 upload of multiple files.  This code is packaged as a tomcat war file in the Servlets directory.

The servlet may well go away as it's functionality is moved to the cocoon based project.  For this reason the documentation has been moved to the Cocoon dir.
