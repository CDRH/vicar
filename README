There are currently two components to vicar; the Servlets code and the Cocoon code.

The Cocoon directory contains the core project which is built as a cocoon generator with xslt processing of the generator output.  This core callsd a small servlet component to read the html5 upload of multiple files.  This code is packaged as a tomcat war file in the Servlets directory.
